# W1D1 Notes

* Intro to CLI
* Intro to Vagrant
* Intro to Git

## CLI

Terminal.app

Starts off on your Mac

`cd` into where the `Vagrantfile` is located (where you `vagrant init`d)

`vagrant ssh` (assumes the machine is already running. `vagrant up`)

Once you're in, u're in the VM, which is an ubuntu linux machine.

`logout` to go back to your Mac on the same terminal.

## Vagrant

A virtual laptop inside your laptop.

The VM doesnt have a GUI so the only way is thru SSH.

You can use `vagrant halt` to power it off. Use `-f` to FORCE shutdown.

The `/vagrant` folder is a shared / sync'd folder b/w your host (mac) and your guest (dev) machine.

All your work should be in the `/vagrant` directory when logged in to the VM. It should be ideally organized in sub directories.

IMPORTANT: `/home/vagrant` and `/vagrant` are not the same folders. You should be working in the latter since it's the only "sync'd" folder.

## Unix commands

Understanding paths may seem tricky at first.

Don't use uppercase / spaces in file/folder names!

Use tab for auto completion

## Git

See slides. :)
